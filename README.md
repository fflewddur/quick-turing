# net.straylightlabs.quickturing.QuickTuring
A fast Java implementation of Qualcomm's Turing stream cipher.

This code is based on Joseph Dudar's initial Java port, available at
http://www.jdudar.com/turing/index.html. It has been optimized similarly
to the Fast Turing C implementation from Qualcomm and runs an order of
magnitude faster than the Java reference implementation.
